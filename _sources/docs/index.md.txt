# Programming for Quantitative Economics

```{note}
This collection of lectures was built using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro).
```

This book presents a set of lectures on python programming for quantitative economics, designed and written by **[Thomas J. Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/)** and **[John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/)**.

## About Lectures

This is one of a series of online texts on modern quantitative economics and programming with Python. This is the first text in the series, which focuses on programming in Python.

### Fixing Your Local Environment

The basic assumption of the lectures is that code in a lecture should
execute whenever

1.  it is executed in a Jupyter notebook and
2.  the notebook is running on a machine with the latest version of
    Anaconda Python.

You have installed Anaconda, haven\'t you, following the instructions in
{ref}`this lecture <getting_started>`?

Assuming that you have, the most common source of problems for our
readers is that their Anaconda distribution is not up to date.

[Here\'s a useful
article](https://www.anaconda.com/keeping-anaconda-date/) on how to
update Anaconda.

Another option is to simply remove Anaconda and reinstall.

You also need to keep the external code libraries, such as [QuantEcon.py](https://quantecon.org/quantecon-py) up to date.

For this task you can either

-   use `pip install --upgrade quantecon` on the command
    line, or
-   execute `!pip install \--upgrade quantecon` within a
    Jupyter notebook.

If your local environment is still not working you can do two things.

First, you can use a remote machine instead, by clicking on the `Launch
Notebook` icon available for each lecture

Second, you can report an issue, so we can try to fix your local set up.

We like getting feedback on the lectures so please don\'t hesitate to
get in touch.

### Reporting an Issue

One way to give feedback is to raise an issue through our [issue tracker](https://github.com/QuantEcon/lecture-source-py/issues).

Please be as specific as possible. Tell us where the problem is and as
much detail about your local set up as you can provide.

Another feedback option is to use our [discourse
forum](https://discourse.quantecon.org/).

Finally, you can provide direct feedback to <contact@quantecon.org>
